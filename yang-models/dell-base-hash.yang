    description
        "When several routing paths exist between two nodes,
         and are equally good (in terms of capacity and
         latency), it is desirable to share the traffic among them.
         Two of the common techniques to use this mechanism Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) routing and
         Link aggregation (LAG).

         In order to determine what is the desirable next-hop NPUs use applies various hashing techniques
         on the incoming traffic.The hashing technique to be applied is determined based on the
         incoming traffic type and the associated hashing-fields.

         This YANG model contains a collection of YANG definitions for managing
         these LAG/ECMP specific hashing techniques used in the NPUs.
